* TODO add a version with reproduced scan lines
* TODO support more sizes
need some sizes between 20px and 40px since 20px is sometimes too small and 40px is sometimes too big
* TODO create version without adjusted aspect ratio 
maybe should revisit having multiple aspect ratios 
* TODO xterm 80col/136col modes
unsure how this works, but should get it set up so that it works in vttest with the correct 80col and 136col charsets
* TODO make build script that doesn't require using a repl
* TODO create github release
* TODO add other Digital fonts (specifically vt100 which there is a rom dump for)
* TODO create packages
** TODO create PKGBUILD and upload to aur
** TODO create DEB
** TODO create RPM and upload to copr
** TODO create gentoo package?
** TODO create Guix package
